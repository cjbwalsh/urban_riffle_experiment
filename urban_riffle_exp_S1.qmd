This document provides further detail on the study sites (@tbl-site_details), and photos of the constructed riffles placed in the 6 impact sites (@fig-site_photos). *Further details to come on missing data*

Reach slope and other channel dimensions were measured in a survey of the reach upstream and downstream of the sampled reach before riffle construction."

Riffles after construction in each 'impact' site.

(There is a 'before' photo of Scotchmans in the survey file: must be an after photo of the riffle somewhere!)
