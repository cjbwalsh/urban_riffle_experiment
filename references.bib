	shorttitle = {Protection of in-stream biota from urban impacts: minimise catchment imperviousness or improve drainage design?},
	abstract = {Urbanization is a looming global threat to in-stream biodiversity, but the best approaches to mitigation are unclear.  This paper asks if the protection of in-stream biota, in particular macroinvertebrate assemblages, is dependent on the sequestration of catchments from urbanization, or if protection in urbanized catchments can be achieved through better drainage design.  In-stream macroinvertebrate assemblage composition was assessed for 16 catchments spanning a rural-urban gradient.  Catchment imperviousness and drainage connection (the proportion of impervious area directly connected to streams by stormwater pipes), together with other possible driving factors, were assessed as explanatory variables of macroinvertebrate assemblage composition.  The proportion of variance explained independently and jointly by each variable was assessed by hierarchical partitioning.  Assemblage composition was strongly explained by the gradient of urban density (i.e. a large proportion of variance was jointly explained by variables correlated with the urban gradient: imperviousness, connection, longitude and elevation).  However, drainage connection was the strongest independent correlate.  Most sensitive taxa were absent from sites with {\textgreater}20\% connection.  Thus the connection of impervious surfaces to streams by pipes is a more likely determinant of taxa loss than the impervious areas themselves.   Low-impact urban design approaches that reduce drainage connection are postulated as the most effective management solution to the protection of stream biota in urban catchments.},

   abstract = {Stan is a probabilistic programming language for specifying statistical models. A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

Three dominant perspectives compete to influence the science and practice of river restoration. A strong focus on channel morphology has led to approaches that involve major Earth-moving activities, such as channel reconfiguration with the unmet assumption that ecological recovery will follow. Functional perspectives of river restoration aim to regain the full suite of biogeochemical, ecological, and hydrogeomorphic processes that make up a healthy river, and though there is well-accepted theory to support this, research on methods to implement and assess functional restoration projects is in its infancy. A plethora of new studies worldwide provide data on why and how rivers are being restored as well as the project outcomes. Measurable improvements postrestoration vary by restoration method and measure of outcome.},

Sample plots and underwater observations were employed to assess patterns of microhabitat use by both species. Quantitative sampling using a prepositioned electrofishing sampler demonstrated that species segregated by microhabitats. Etheostoma maculatum occupied areas of greater depth and larger, more diverse substrate sizes than E. bellum in July and October of 1991. Underwater observations also revealed species-specific differences in substrate use. Etheostoma maculatum was observed mostly under rocks whereas E. bellum was more general in substrate use. The narrow range of microhabitat use by E. maculatum may contribute to its status as a threatened species in Kentucky. During July 1991, an unusually high discharge month that year, males of both species occupied microhabitats of significantly higher velocities and larger substrate sizes than females. Our data suggest that opportunities for coexistence between these closely related darters are enhanced by microhabitat partitioning which is linked to behavioral and morphological differences.},

	abstract = {Over the last century, under the modern hydraulic model, waterways across the world have been heavily canalized and culverted, driven into underground pipes, drains and sewers. This hydraulic approach has hardwired an isolated water network into the urban fabric, fragmenting erstwhile patterns and dynamics of life, both human and nonhuman. Ecologically, it has been hugely damaging, reducing water quality and biotic diversity, but also socially, disconnecting citizens from the waterways that service and characterize the city. Consequently, since the 1990s, waterway restoration has become widespread as a design solution to degraded rivers and streams, reinstating compromised hydrological, geomorphological and ecological processes. Deculverting or ‘daylighting’, the focus of this paper, is a radical form of restoration, opening up subterranean, culverted waterways often forgotten by communities above ground. Yet, as this paper emphasizes, waterway restoration has tended to privilege ecological over social objectives, while public engagement in project conceptualization has been limited, conducted ‘downstream’ subsequent to planning and design stages. Restoration schemes have therefore tended to reflect the concerns of professionals rather than communities, overlooking their potential for social renewal and change. Drawing on workshop data collected through participatory mapping exercises, this paper explores the case for daylighting a culverted brook in Urmston, Greater Manchester, focusing in particular on the preferences, concerns and knowledge of local residents. The paper compares professional and community perspectives on the preferred scheme design and potential benefits of daylighting, drawing out differences and tensions between them, temporarily ‘unblackboxing’ the brook. It is ventured that daylighting can unleash the social ‘stickiness’ of water, its proclivity to draw and bind together, to revitalize the park, enhancing connection to wildness, attachment to place and sense of community. This is particularly crucial in the face of decreased local authority funding and related crises in park management.},

	abstract = {Urban stream rehabilitation projects commonly include log placement to establish the types of habitat features associated with large woody debris (LWD) in undisturbed streams. Six urban in-stream rehabilitation projects were examined in the Puget Sound Lowland of western Washington. Each project used in-stream log placement as the primary strategy for achieving project goals; none included systematic watershed-scale rehabilitation measures. The effectiveness of LWD in these projects was evaluated by characterizing physical stream conditions using common metrics, including LWD frequency and pool spacing, and by sampling benthic macroinvertebrates. In all project reaches where pre-project data existed, pool spacing narrowed after LWD installation. All project sites exhibited fewer pools for a given LWD loading, however, than has been reported for forested streams. In project reaches where the objective was to control downstream sedimentation, only limited success was observed. At none of the sites was there any detectable improvement in biological conditions due to the addition of LWD. Our results indicate that, although LWD projects can modestly improve physical habitat in, a stream reach over a time scale of 2-10 years, they apparently do not achieve commensurate improvement in biological conditions.},
